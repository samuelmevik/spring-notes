# Hibernate and JPA

## Overview

A framework for persisting Java objects in a relational database. It provides an object-relational mapping (ORM) solution to map Java classes to database tables and vice versa. Hibernate is an implementation of the Java Persistence API (JPA) specification.

## Benefits

1. Handles all the low level SQL.
2. Minimizes the amount of JDBC that I need to write.
3. Provides the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework.

## JPA

JPA (Jakarta Persistence API) is a specification, defined by a set of interfaces, that describes the management of relational data in applications. It provides a standard way to work with databases using Java objects.

## Benefits

1. Standardizes the way I interact with databases. Not vendor locked.
2. Maintain portable, flexible code by coding to the JPA standard.
